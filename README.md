# My First Unity Repository  

This is my first Git repository created to learn Unity and version control with Git.  

## About This Repository  
- This repository will store my Unity projects, scripts, and other files related to learning game development.  
- I will use Git to track changes, collaborate, and maintain version control.  
- This will help me practice using **Git branches**, **commits**, and **pull requests**.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Unity** (Game Engine)  
- **C#** (Programming Language)  
- **Git & GitHub** (Version Control)  
- **SourceTree / Git Fork** (Git Client for easier Git operations)  

## Goals  
1. Learn how to use **Git** and **GitHub** with Unity projects.  
2. Understand **branching, committing, and pushing changes**.  
3. Work on **small Unity projects** and track progress.  
4. Get hands-on experience with **collaborative development using Git**.  
5. Improve debugging and version management in Unity projects.  

## Getting Started
